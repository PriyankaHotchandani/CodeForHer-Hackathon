# Code-For-Her-Hackathon
First hackathon participation, worked with team members Prachi Randeria (github: appleblaze) and Gayatri Patil(github: gayatri-p786) and won the "BEST HACK" title.

Built a website consisting of a blog and a discussion form. The blog can be accessed by any user while the forum can only be accessed by the members. The main page also gives the description of the non-profit organisation - Aspire For Her. 

The first page of the website can be accessed by index.php which displays information about the organisation and has links to the blog and forum. The project won't fully run without the database files.
